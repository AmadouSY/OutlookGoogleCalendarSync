# Application Versions

The software can either be installed or run as a "portable" application. The installed version will suffice for the majority of people. 

In terms of functionality, both versions are the same, but here's a quick comparison:


|  | Installed | Portable |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Set Up | Download the `Setup.exe` file, double-click it to execute, and OGCS will start. | Download the `Portable ZIP` file and then extract the compressed files to a location of your choosing. Double-click the `OutlookGoogleCalendarSync.exe` executable file to start OGCS. |
| Application Location | The local `APPDATA` folder for the user. | Anywhere, possibly a USB drive. |
| Upgrading OGCS | Simply accept the upgrade prompt when a newer version is detected. | The newer ZIP file will need manually downloading, either to replace the existing location of OGCS, or a new location. |
| OS Permissions Required | None. | None. |
| Multiple versions | Only one version at a time. | Each extracted application is standalone, so multiple versions is fine. You may want this to experiment with different releases of OGCS. |
| Multiple configurations/settings | Only one. | Settings are specific to each extract of OGCS, by default. |
| Sync multiple calendars | Not yet possible. | Configure a calendar for each OGCS deployment. |
